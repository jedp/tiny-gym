![Tiny Weight Gym](tiny-gym.jpg)

From smoll to swole!

I've modeled a tiny strength training gym for this little bear. Should also be
usable by Calico Critters.

Fusion 360 files for a tiny
- Adjustable squat rack
- Weights (45, 25, 10, 5)
- Weight rack

These files were exported in the `stl` format, and then sliced and Printed on a
Prusa I3 MK3S to produce the models in the image above.
